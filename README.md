# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
If you've stumbled across my page... it's pretty clear that I'm not *that* active on GitHub. 

This site is an ongoing project. Maybe it'll have some React, some weird CSS (some stuff might break), or whatever widgets. Maybe I'll share it as a portfolio soon!

I didn't use Squarespace or Wordpress to make my site, because that's not my goal. I don't necessarily want a personal website (or even a MVP), rather I need a platform to develop my web design skillsâ€“for **free** and **at my own pace**.
