# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
If you've stumbled across my page... it's pretty clear that I'm not *that* active on GitHub. But if I'm qualified to post anything, then it's this ðŸ˜Š

This site is an ongoing projectâ€“maybe it'll have some React, experimental CSS (some stuff might break), and tests for widgets.

I didn't use Squarespace or Wordpress to make my site, because that's not my goal. I don't necessarily want a personal website (or even a MVP), rather I need a platform to develop my skills in web design and portfolio buildingâ€“**at my own pace**. Hopefully it'll fill in my activity graph a bit, so I can use it as a way to track my progress and stay motivated.

If you have ideas or feedback, or think I have something to offer, please feel free to message me! Thanks âœ¨
