# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
If you've stumbled across my page... it's pretty clear that I'm not *that* active on GitHub. 

This site is an ongoing project, basically my playground for learning React. Most edits will stay local, and I might start over a few times until I get the hang of things. No shame in learning by trial-and-error!

I didn't use Squarespace or Wordpress to make my site, because that's not my goal here. My goal isn't necessarily to have a personal website (or even a MVP), rather it's to learn React on my own, for **free** and **at my own pace**.
